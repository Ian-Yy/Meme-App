# Meme-App

The main idea is to provide a seemless interface for creating memes on web, while I have personally enjoyed creating memes on apps in phones but sometimes you just need a web-app on a big screen. This is the solution to that problem.

## Github actions
If you have already enabled ssh for your GitHub account, you can use that public/private key pair. Else you will need to create a new one.

### create a public/private key

```bash
cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "$(git config user.email)" -f gh-pages-actions -N ""
```

Donâ€™t forget to replace user.email with your e-mail address. 

You need to insert the public key you have generated into the text-area. Insert Public key of ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY for the title input field. Check Allow write access and click on the Add key button.

### view the public key

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/gh-pages-actions.pub
```
Next, up go to the secrets tab and add a new secret key. This is the private ssh key that you generated. You can view it like this. In the name field, add ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/gh-pages-actions
```
We have integrated GitHub Actions into your workflow.
